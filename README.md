# Emp_Turnover_ML_Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether an employee is likely to leave the organization using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and deployment of a prediction tool.

## üìå Project Objectives
- Analyze employee-related data to understand key factors contributing to attrition.
- Build predictive models to classify employees as retained or at-risk.
- Identify important features influencing employee turnover.
- Create a simple, user-friendly interface for real-time prediction.

## üîß Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data handling
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Streamlit** for building the prediction web app
- **VS Code**

## üìä Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Satisfaction Level
- Last Evaluation
- Number of Projects
- Average Monthly Hours
- Time Spent at Company
- Work Accident
- Promotion in Last 5 Years
- Department
- Salary

## üîç Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualizing turnover trends
   - Distribution of features

3. **Model Building**
   - Train-test split
   - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC
   - Evaluation using accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score

4. **Feature Importance**
   - Identifying top factors influencing employee exit

5. **Deployment**
   - Streamlit-based web app for prediction
   - Input employee features and get real-time prediction
